## Project Description

International terrorism is a threat that every country in the world faced. Violent extremism is any form of violence carried out by an individual, or an organization on a population, with the aim of destablising the society and government. Often, the violence is an means to bring about regime change and toppling of the incumbent government. 

No one country can stop terrorism or violent extremism. Intelligence and security agencies must be able to detect, disrupt and dismantle terrorist cells and networks before they can carry out their operations. Towards this goal, government all over the world work in a concerted effort to share intelligence about suspects, so that law enforcement can strike before the perpertrators themselves do.

Nonetheless, the decades since the early 2000s are marked by terrorist attacks in nearly every continent. Many of these attacks resulted in a loss of life, property and destablisation of the incumbent government. 

This project analyses the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), which is an open-source database containing information on worldwide terrorist attacks since 1970 to 2017. We will create an interactive dashboard in Looker Studio.
